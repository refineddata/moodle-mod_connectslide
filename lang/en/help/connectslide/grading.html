<h1>Grading</h1>

<p>With Detailed Grading off, simply running the Activity
produces a 100% grade.  This will likely be the most
common setting, and is the default.</p>

<p>The grading fields give you the opportunity to alter
a grade based on the number of slides viewed or the number
of minutes in a meeting or presentation.</p>

<p>The threshold is dependent on the type of activity:<br/>
Slideshow: number of slides<br/>
Meeting: minutes in meeting<br/>
Quiz: grade on quiz<br/>
Video: position reached (1=5%, 2=25%, 3=50%, 4=75%, 5=95%)<p/>

<p>Starting with the highest first, enter the threshold, then 
the grade achieved for reaching that threshold.  Not reaching 
the lowest threshold will result in a 0% grade.  Usually the
first threshold will be what is required for 100%</p>

<p>For example, for a meeting, if you enter:</p>

<p>Threshhold: 30<br />
Grade: 100%<br />
Threshold: 20<br />
Grade: 80%<br />
</p>

<p>Then being in this meeting for 10 minutes will result in 0%.
Being in this meeting for 20 minutes will result in 80%.  Being
in this meeting for 30 minutes will result in 100%.</p>
