<h1>Initial Delay before Grading</h1>

<p>When grading Connect Activities, a delay is needed
to get the grades from the Connect server.  After a
set period of time, these grades need to be recovered
from that server.

<p>A good delay would be the expected length of the meeting,
or the expected time to complete the slideshow or presentation.</p>
