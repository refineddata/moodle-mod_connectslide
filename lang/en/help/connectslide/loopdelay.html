<h1>Delay between rechecks of grading</h1>

<p>When getting grades from the Connect server, on
the first pass, the grades may not yet be available.
This could be because the meeting is still going on, 
or the participant is delayed in watching the slideshow
or presentation.</p>

<p>The delay between rechecks of grading is the amount
of time to wait before rechecking the grades on the
Connect server.</p>
