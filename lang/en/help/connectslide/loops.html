<h1>Number of times to recheck grading</h1>

<p>When getting grades from the Connect server, on
the first pass, the grades may not yet be available.
This could be because the meeting is still going on, 
or the participant is delayed in watching the slideshow
or presentation.</p>

<p>The number of times to recheck grading represents how 
many times to go back to the server to check for grades
before giving up.</p>
